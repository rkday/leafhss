# LeafHSS

A modern open-source HSS for use in IMS networks.

The current version is available for download [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/org.leafhss/org.leafhss.hss-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar) and can be run with `java -jar org.leafhss.hss-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar [options]`

## Usage

LeafHSS has two modes - a full mode (where subscriber data is provisioned and stored in a database) and an auto-answer mode (where all requests receive default responses) which is useful for testing other IMS components. The auto-answer mode currently works, and the full mode is still in development.

To start LeafHSS in auto-answer mode, use the command-line option `--autoanswer`. Four other command-line options control the responses:

- `--scscf-sip-uri` sets the S-CSCF with which all subscribers are considered registered
- `--visited-network-id` sets the access network which all subscribers are allowed to register from
- `--digest-realm` sets the realm used in SIP Digest authentication
- `--standard-password` sets the password used for all subscribers

In this mode:

- User-Authorization-Requests succeed if the Visited-Network matches the --visited-network-id parameter and the Public-Identity is the SIP URI variant of the User-Name (e.g "sip:1234@example.com" and "1234@example.com"). The User-Authorization-Answer contains the Server-Name set by the `--scscf-sip-uri` parameter
- Multimedia-Auth-Requests succeed if the Public-Identity is the SIP URI variant of the User-Name (e.g "sip:1234@example.com" and "1234@example.com") and the authentication type requested is "SIP Digest" or "Unknown". The answer always contains the realm specified by the `--digest-realm` parameter and a HA1 created by a hash of the User-Name, the realm and the password specified by the `--standard-password` parameter.
- Server-Assignment-Requests succeed if the Public-Identity is the SIP URI variant of the User-Name (e.g "sip:1234@example.com" and "1234@example.com"). The User-Data in the answer contains no initial filter criteria.
- Location-Information-Requests always succeed. The answer contains the Server-Name set by the `--scscf-sip-uri` parameter.

## Diameter

LeafHSS uses the Mobicents jDiameter stack, and so Diameter-level configuration (e.g. peers allowed to connect) must be specified in a Jdiameter config file. The `--jdiameter-config` command line option allows you to specify which config file to use; an example file is [available here](https://raw.github.com/rkday/leafhss/master/resources/config.xml), and [Red Hat have a guide to the configuration here](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Communications_Platform/5.1/html/Diameter_User_Guide/jdiameter-configuration.html).
